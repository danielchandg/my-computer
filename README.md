# My Computer

I saved my project to my computer but now I can't find it! It seems like I don't have access to most of the folders on my computer either for some reason. I suspect foul play.

# Graph

This graph outlines the file directory of my computer. Some files require special access to open. Special access can be obtained by snooping through files on my computer. Green text indicates you are viewing a file for the first time. Blue text indicates you unlocked something.
